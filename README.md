# Digital_Image_Processing-Median_Filter_and_Adaptive_Median_Filter

â–¶ Implement each filter

* Median Filter

  -Filter size must be entered randomly

* Adaptive Median Filter

  -The filter start size is 3, and the filter maximum size must be entered arbitrarily.

* Input image: circuit512.raw

  -Image size: 512 x 512

  -Insert S & P Noise into this image with arbitrary probability, input it into the filter and check the result

* By varying the filter size and the probability of S & P noise, Find out what the difference in filtering results from change

* Identify the characteristics of each filter that you can see from the filtering results
